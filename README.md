inspired by : https://github.com/Jasawyn/Microsoft-Defender-Bypass-For-XenoRAT/tree/main

i basically kinda copied his code and also took inspiration from a lot of other scripts, this script runs easy on attiny85, because my first usb broke because of Jasawyn's script being too heavy...
ty for all the people that posted their progress for the public to see because it helped me immensely ^^
